The Basics:
-Game is an action RPG with some platforming elements
-Combat will consist of killing enemies using a variety of methods including
melee weapons of various lengths, guns, magic spells, and hazards within
the environment(exploding barrels, bursting steam valves, really sharp
icicles, etc.)
-Platforming will be simple: the player must jump over anything that will
impale him/burn him/disintegrate him/make him fall into a bottomless
abyss of inky blackness
-Characters gain EXP for finishing quests and killing enemies
-Characters will level up independently from each other(each character will
require different amounts of EXP to level up, and each level up will grant
different amounts of stat gains)
-There are nine level-variable stats in the game, five of which(attack, 
defense,speed, vigor, and stamina) are accessible to every character. Each 
character will possess seven level-variable stats.

The stats are as follows:
  -Attack: determines the damage a physical attack by the player will deal,
as well as the knockback the attack will cause to the enemy
  -Defense: determines the damage taken by incoming attacks
  -Speed: determines movement speed and the ability to dodge attacks
  -Vigor: determines how high the critical hit rate is for the player's
attacks, as well as how low the critical hit rate is for attacks against
the player. Also determines the player's chance to survive an otherwise
fatal blow
  -Stamina: used to perform dodges and special abilities(explained in the 
combat section), depletes with use and replenishes over time
  -Willpower: determines the damage magic attacks deal, as well as the 
damage received from magic attacks
  -Focus: determines the damage absorbed by magic shields, the HP 
replenished by cure magic, the duration of spells' effects, and the
effectiveness of buff/debuff spells
  -Marksmanship: determines recoil, reload speed, and jam frequency when
using guns
  -Magic resistance: For non-magic users, determines damage dealt by
incoming magic attacks

There are two non-level-variable stats in the game, one of which is
available to all characters. They are:
  -HP: a value that falls when the player takes damage, killing the player
when it reaches zero. Fixed at 100 for all characters
  -MP: used to cast spells for magic users. Upgradeable through the use of
items


Movement+Camera:
-Free (non grid-based) movement eg. player may move up, down, left, and
right as well as diagonally
-Three-quarters view, similar to games such as the first six FF games, 
LttP, Chrono Trigger, Mother, Secret of Mana, etc. (IT'S NOT CALLED 
ISOMETRIC EDDIE YOU BITCH)
-Player is fixed to the middle of the screen as the camera scrolls with his
movement
-Ability to jump, which could be shown as the player's sprite moving a
bit closer to the camera and a shadow appearing underneath him
-Ability to dodge using a quick shuffle/roll in any direction
-Ability to "look ahead" by moving the camera freely when not moving
(in case player is feeling sneaky-sneaky and wants to spy on enemies)
-Ability to strafe (useful for guns)

Combat:
-Imagine combat as something similar to 2D Zelda games at its core, but with
a good deal more complexity(real-time combat with the ability to use
melee or ranged weapons)

-There are four main classes of attack:
  -One-handed melee: includes knives and gloves; generally have a shorter
range and lower damage than two-handed melee weapons, but have a higher
attack rate. Counts as physical attack
  -Two-handed melee: includes swords and staves; generally slower than
one-handed melee weapons, but have a longer range and higher damage. Counts
as physical attack
  -Guns: pretty self-explanitory, includes any ranged weapon; attack rate
and damage will vary greatly. Counts as physical attack
  -Magic: includes offensive magic spells which can either cause damage
instantly or over a period of time. Relies on vigor stat

-Enemies fall into three categories:
  -Creatures: hostile things that aren't human
  -Troops: human military units
  -Machines: lack the organic carbon-based compounds and souls that we 
privileged folks possess

-Status conditions may be inflicted by certain weapons or attacks. They are
as follows:
  -Wound: inflicts a bleeding wound that drains HP, ineffective on machines
and strong against troops
  -Burn: inflicts heavy damage to the skin, lowering attack and defense, 
ineffective on troops and strong against creatures
  -Stun: sends a shock that lowers speed and vigor, ineffective on creatures
but strong against machines
  -Corrupt: enemies will begin to attack their own allies while the player
will have his movement controls shuffled for a short time, works neutrally
on all enemies

-Special abilities are certain tactics that are unique to each player
character. Examples are:
  -Wyatt's ability to go on a rampant killing spree, hitting every enemy on
the screen for MASSIVE DAMAGE
  -Bryce's ability to let out a burst of speed, propelling himself towards
a distant enemy to perform an execution(also useful for traversing 
obstacles)
