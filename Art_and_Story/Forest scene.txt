OUTDOORS SCENE
Jeremiah
Farrand
ends pretty much when meets guards


J: Farrand, we are about half way to Zeselia, we should make it there within the next week.
F: Good, Waldomar said this meeting will be peaceful but keep your wits about you, I fear he may have bad intentions. 
J: Really?
 F: Yes, his father was from the old world where man was left unchecked. Over the years humanity ravaged the world with nuclear war and ecological destruction in search of wealth and power. Isthmo is one of the only habitable areas left on earth that still has valuable resources so I
 wouldn’t be surprised if he tries to take it all for himself. 
J: With an all out war? Do they really think they can stand up to us with our advanced magic and ** THE SPORE THING**?.
F: We can’t be sure. They too have made progress with their weaponry since the last great war ended 20 years ago. Granted, they still use gunpowder so who knows..
J: Interesting.
F:  But the fact remains that Waldomar II has been encroaching on our land for the 2 years now and believes we haven’t noticed. Our scouts have also reported his troops mobilizing along our borders. 
J: In that case I fear the worst may come of this meeting. Are you sure its a good idea?
F: The chance to avoid a second war, however slim it may be, is worth the risk.
J:  Good point. 
*time passes?* 
J:There’s a stream up ahead. We can set up camp for the night there.
