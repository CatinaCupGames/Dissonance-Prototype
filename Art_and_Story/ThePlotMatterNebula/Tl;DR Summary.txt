So I realized my new summary is less of a summary and more of a complete outline, so this is as simple as it gets right here.

-Adler empire, led by Waldomar II, needs resources and space to expand
-Adler troops are mobilized and sent to conquer all of Isthmo Candidus, killing all "non-believers" in the process
-In the humble settlement of Nuado, a sage, Farrand, sends a warrior-in-training, Huxley, and his own son, Wyatt, to deliver a parcel to Adoma City, Isthmo's most populated settlement outside of Adler control
-Meanwhile, a homeless delinquent turned-Adler recruit, Bryce, goes AWOL to avoid killing innocent people
-Bryce meets Wyatt and Huxley and they all go and fight the Adlers at Adoma
-Huxley get shot but lives, almost gets captured by Waldomar's henchmen, stays and gets healed by the sage of Adoma
-The rest of the gang joins up with Amynta, the sage's bodyguard, and they all go back to Nuado
-Nuado gets invaded, Farrand dies, Wyatt swears revenge on the Adlers
-With the help of Farrand's assistant, Jeremiah, the party plans a counteroffense against the Adlers
-The party regroups with Huxley and travels around Isthmo, fighting the Adlers and spreading word of a rebellion. All goes as planned UNTIL...
-The party is ambushed and Huxley gets captured. Wyatt, Huxley, and Amynta are rescued by mysterious cat people known as the Reverans
-Working together with the Reverans, the party continues to fight back against the Adlers and enter their capitol, Zesilia, to rescue Huxley
-Huxley has been "reconditioned" by Waldomar and transformed into a super-soldier. He and Wyatt fight, resulting in Huxley returning to his old self and committing suicide out of remorse
-Wyatt infiltrates Zesilia's capitol building, where Waldomar resides, while the rest of the party provides support from the outside
-In a final showdown between Wyatt and Waldomar, both are killed. The city explodes into mass chaos
-As all order ceases, Isthmo begins to "shut down", the sky flickers and turns to static, structures collapse at a rapid rate, electrical storms wipe out a staggering amount of life
-Story ends with Bryce and Amynta evacuating into the world beyond Isthmo
