This is the story outline, which will explain the plot itself without going
into any detail about the explanation of themes or dialogue. The story is 
divided into acts, which each cover one period of time (e.g. Act II covers
from the battle at Adoma to Farrand's death). Acts are further divided into 
chapters, which are defined as one party's perspective of an act (e.g.
Wyatt and Huxley's trip to Adoma takes place at the same time as Bryce's 
escape from the Adlers but they are covered in different chapters). Scenes 
even further divide chapters into manageable chunks (e.g. Wyatt and Huxley's
fireside chat is a different scene than Farrand giving Wyatt the package to 
deliver).

Chapter 1: Nuado
____________________________________________________________________________
Scene 1
-story begins in Nuado City, a modest agricultual settlement in South-
Eastern Isthmo
-Wyatt and Huxley meet up on the outskirts of town in the evening to have 
a smoke
-As they walk along a narrow path surrounded by a dense field of crops,
Huxley worries about the reprocussions of staying out late at night
-The two set up a bonfire at a clearing near a river and share their
thoughts on what the world outside of Nuado is like
-Huxley walks over to the river, noticing a plume of smoke on the horizon,
and calls Wyatt over
-The two hypothesize that there is another group of boys enjoying themselves
on the other side of the river
-After the fire begins to die down, they toss some water on it and head back
to town
-On the way back, a swarm of insects blocks their path
-The player takes control of the boys, fighting off the creatures with
Wyatt's water bucket and Huxley's slingshot
-This part acts as a tutorial to combat and basic platforming, with the boys
having to jump up ledges
-Once the boys return to town, Huxley goes back on his own to his house
-The player controls Wyatt as he walks back to his house in the center of 
town
-Night falls upon Nuado and the opening credits roll as Wyatt walks
 -The red glow of evening gradually fades to a dark blue, reaching its
darkest point just as the player reaches the door of the house
____________________________________________________________________________
-Wyatt opens the door slowly, as if to come in unnoticed
-The interior of the house is inviting, with stained wood floors and walls
lined with ornate lanterns
-Farrand, waiting at the dinner table in the middle of the room, calls Wyatt
over and jokingly scolds him for not being able to sneak in
-He notices some insect blood on Wyatt's sleeve and asks him about his and Huxley's
"hunting session"
-Wyatt replies that the bugs were particularly aggressive, attacking unprovoked
when they walked near them
-Farrand says that "it's probably nothing" and tells him that he should probably get some rest
