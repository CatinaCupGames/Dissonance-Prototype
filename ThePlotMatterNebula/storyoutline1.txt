This is the story outline, which will explain the plot itself without going
into any detail about the explanation of themes or dialogue. The story is 
divided into acts, which each cover one period of time (e.g. Act II covers
from the battle at Adoma to Farrand's death). Acts are further divided into 
chapters, which are defined as one party's perspective of an act (e.g.
Wyatt and Huxley's trip to Adoma takes place at the same time as Bryce's 
escape from the Adlers but they are covered in different chapters). Scenes 
even further divide chapters into manageable chunks (e.g. Wyatt and Huxley's
fireside chat is a different scene than Farrand giving Wyatt the package to 
deliver).

a smoke

thoughts on what the world outside of Nuado is like

and calls Wyatt over
-The two hypothesize that there is another group of boys enjoying themselves
on the other side of the river
-After the fire begins to die down, they toss some water on it and head back
to town
-On the way back, a swarm of insects blocks their path
-The player takes control of the boys, fighting off the creatures with
Wyatt's fists and Huxley's slingshot

having to jump up ledges

-The player controls Wyatt as he walks back to his house in the center of 
town
-Night falls upon Nuado and the opening credits roll as Wyatt walks
