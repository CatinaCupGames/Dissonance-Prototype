Setting/Backstory:
-Takes place on Isthmo Candidus, a vast, largely flat land
bridge with a temperate climate
-Story begins on the 50th year of the Aldan Calendar, or 
approximately 4500 A.D. on the Gregorian Calendar
-Isthmo Candidus was created about 500 years before the 
start of the story as part of an elaborate experiment
started by the Sino-American Empire in an attempt to establish a utopia
-Isthmo is occupied by two major powers: Adlerland and The Expiditus
      The Expiditus:
      -Expiditus in Latin means "free, unburdened"
      -Ideals reflect the beginnings of life on Isthmo, as technology remains relatively primitive and 
      society is agrarian
